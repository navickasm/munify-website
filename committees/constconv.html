  <h2>Letter from the Chair</h2>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Hi Everyone! I’m Ren D’Attilio and I will be the chair of the 1787 Constitutional Convention Committee at MUNIFY 2025. I am a Junior at Deerfield High School and a member of the DHS Model UN team. I also am a part of the school’s Debate and Scholastic Bowl Teams. My interests include history, politics and economics. In my free time, I enjoy watching sitcoms and taking long, recharging naps.</p>
  <p>I am incredibly excited to chair a committee full of fun, chaos and colonial shenanigans of epic proportions. This divergent time in American history had monumental impacts on today's world, and I hope that this committee will produce results just as interesting. As can be inferred from the name, members from the committee will be portraying delegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1787. As the delegates guiding the formation of the new nation through policy and function, expect to be well versed on the powers you hold, and how they can be used.</p>
  <p>The United States was founded on the principles of liberty, justice and the pursuit of happiness, but as great as our constitution is, it has faced its fair struggle on what it was intended to achieve. I only hope the delegates to this convention, can right the wrongs of the past, and lead the nation to develop into an even more perfect union. Will the founding fathers be able to establish the world’s greatest democracy and parent the young nation’s pathway to prosperity? Or will they instead be defined by the tyranny they sought to destroy. I am eager and excited to see which path this committee embarks on, and what its consequences are not only for America, but for the world as we know it.</p>
  <p>I’ll leave you delegates with this, some inspiring words from our very own 46th President:</p>
  <p>“We are America, second to none, and we own the finish line. Don't forget it.” - President Joseph R. Biden</p>
