  <h2>Letter from the Chair</h2>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Greetings,</p>
  <p>I am Josh Koyfman, the Secretary-General of MUNIFY and Chair of the <b>A</b>d-Hoc Committee of the Secretary-General on [REDACTED]. I can’t wait for you to experience the conference that I and the entire Secretariat have worked tirelessly to plan.</p>
  <p>Model UN has been such an instrumental part of my high school journey. I have loved going to conferences, meeting students from around the <b>w</b>orld, and <b>d</b>iscussing key international affairs. While we can’t replicate the entire high school experience of a Model UN conference, MUNIFY is an attempt to give you a taste of what Model UN is and an opportunity for you to begin developing <b>c</b>ritical life skills. We believe that your involvement to participate will be a memorable experience for you to meet students from the Chicagoland area as well as strong preparation for when you participate in high school Model UN if you choose.</p>
  <p><b>O</b>utside of Model UN, I love playing tennis, watching hockey, and participating on my high school’s DECA and Debate team.</p>
  <p>I could not be more excited for you to experience this year’s Ad-Hoc topic on the [REDACTED]. When drafting committee ideas, we wanted to capture something that had high stakes, required strong diplomacy skills, and was relevant to American history. The [REDACTED] checks all the boxes. Good luck preparing, searching for the clues (one hidden in this <b>l</b>etter), and I look forward to seeing you in May for the inaugural MUNIFY conference. If you have any questions before that, please feel free to email me at 261koyfmanj@student.dist113.org and I will answer any questions you may have.</p>
  <p>Sincerely,<br>
    Josh Koyfman<br>
    Secretary-General of MUNIFY
  </p>
