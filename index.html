<section id="introduction">
  <p>Dear Delegates, Advisers, Parents, and Guests,</p>
  <p>It is my honor as your Secretary-General to welcome you to the inaugural
    conference of the Model United Nations Initiative for Youth (MUNIFY).
    MUNIFY is the premiere Model UN conference in the Midwest area designed
    for middle schoolers. We believe that Model UN equips students with critical
    life skills and we strive to provide an opportunity for students to expand
    these skills from a younger age. Our two-day student-run conference delivers
    an opportunity for middle school students to build new connections with
    students across the Chicagoland area, debate historical as well as current
    international issues, and engage in a memorable experience.</p>
  <p>The Secretariat and I are working tirelessly to craft an inspiring, unique,
    and captivating weekend for everyone involved. We have planned a conference
    that is low-cost to attend, provides beneficial resources to prepare, and
    most importantly, is fun for everyone involved.</p>
  <p>As we finalize our date for MUNIFY, I look forward to what is in store
    and update you once the date is released. If you have any questions
    concerning registration or MUNIFY, please
    <a href="mailto:261koyfmanj@student.dist113.org">email me</a> and I will
    be happy to help you!</p>
  <p>On behalf of the entire Secretariat and myself, welcome to the Model
    United Nations Initiative for Youth!</p>
  <p>Sincerely,</p>
  <p>Joshua Koyfman<br>
    Secretary-General<br>
    MUNIFY<br>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
</section>

<section>
  <p>As we receive questions, we will add them to this section. If you have any
    questions, please direct them to
    <a href="mailto:261koyfmanj@student.dist113.org">the Secretary-General</a>.</p>
  <h3>What differentiates you from other Model UN conferences?</h3>
  <p>MUNIFY is the only Model UN conference in the area exclusively designed for
    middle school students and supported by a full Secretariat of experienced leaders.
    Our conference emphasizes smaller, unique committee experiences rather than
    large, generalized ones, ensuring every participant works in a focused and
    engaging environment. This approach maximizes opportunities for skill-building,
    fosters collaboration, and allows students to develop confidence in smaller
    groups—proven to be highly effective for success at this age.</p>

  <h3>How will my students prepare?</h3>
  <p>We provide comprehensive preparation materials, including detailed background
    guides, resources on parliamentary procedure, and topic-specific information
    tailored for middle school participants. Additionally, our team is available to
    support educators and students with advice on research and strategy to ensure
    they feel confident and ready. Students are encouraged to work collaboratively
    to refine their skills before the conference, and our guides are written to
    accommodate varying levels of prior experience. Such guides will be published
    as they are produced, and resources will be made available in a sufficiently
    advance time to allow students to fully prepare.</p>

  <h3>What financial commitment is required?</h3>
  <p>Our registration fee is designed to be as accessible as possible while
    ensuring a high-quality experience for all participants. While details about
    costs will be finalized January 1, 2025, our tentative model is $5 per rostered
    student, with no school fee. We are committed
    to transparency and are happy to discuss financial considerations with schools
    or teams that may need additional support.</p>

  <h3>Who is your Secretariat?</h3>
  <p>Our Secretariat is composed entirely of dedicated high school students with
    extensive experience in Model UN, particularly in organizing and chairing
    middle school conferences. We bring a deep understanding of what makes a middle
    school-focused conference impactful and engaging. Our team’s firsthand
    experience ensures that every aspect of MUNIFY is thoughtfully designed to
    provide an age-appropriate and enriching experience for all participants.</p>

  <h3>What grades are allowed to participate?</h3>
  <p>Our conference is open to grades 5-8.</p>
